---step 0: setup github
---step 1: draw grid 
---step 2: initialize stations
---step 3: render stations on grid
---step 4: figure out some affinity thing 
step 5: implement mutation (swapping/modifying sattion spots)
step 6: implement occasionally exhanging parts of solution with others (main concurrent problem)
step 7: change from rendering after every iteration to rendering twice per second (total num iterations still unknown)


step 0: DONE
 
step 1&2: DONE
    a- create a javafx scene that just displays an empty App
    b- render a 10x10 grid

step 3: DONE
    a- define the object of the station: DONE
        type
        position
        color
    b- initialize n stations with all fields rendomly generated  DONE
    c- functions needed for stations:
        moveStation - change stationLocation
        adjustColor - changes stationColor
        changeShape - changes stationShape
    d- render stations on grid DONE

step 4: DONE
    affinity function - similar types clustered together = higher affinity

step ???:
    a- implement a function that randomly moves a random subset of size random(8-16) of the stations by a 1 cell in a random direction
    b- implement a funtion that refreshes the grid to display the new locations of stations
    c- implement a loop that moves the sations then displays then repeats
    d- MAYBE implement that the loop of moving the stations runs at the same time as the refreshGrid funtion(which updates 2 per second)
        note: if fast debug change from 2 per second to 30 per second
