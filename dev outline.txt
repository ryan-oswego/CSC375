step 0: get github setup so that i can work on this on my laptop and desktop
step 1: draw grid 
step 2: initialize a set of 64 stations
step 3: render stations on grid
step 3.5: render moved stations
step 4: figure out some affinity thing
step 5: implement affinity thing
step 6: after 1 iteration of moving stations to raise affinity score render objects
step 7: change from rendering after every iteration to rendering twice per second (total num iterations still unknown)
step 8: implement mutation (swapping/modifying sattion spots)
step 9: implement occasionally exhanging parts of solution with others (main concurrent problem)

note: 
    all of these steps need to be further broken down into sub-steps
    the overall steps are subject to change and be broken up into smaller steps or the order chnaged




step 0:
    create repo with the 
    
step 1&2:
    a- create a javafx scene that just displays an empty App
    b- render a 10x10 grid with x and y axis labled

step 3:
    a- define the object of the station:
        stationID
        stationColor
        stationShape
        stationLocation
    b- initialize 64 stations with all fields rendomly generated besides groupId
    c- functions needed for stations:
        moveStation - change stationLocation
        adjustColor - changes stationColor
        changeShape - changes stationShape
    d- render stations on grid

step 3.5:
    a- implement a function that randomly moves a random subset of size random(8-16) of the stations by a 1 cell in a random direction
    b- implement a funtion that refreshes the grid to display the new locations of stations
    c- implement a loop that moves the sations then displays then repeats
    d- MAYBE implement that the loop of moving the stations runs at the same time as the refreshGrid funtion(which updates 2 per second)
        note: if fast debug change from 2 per second to 30 per second

step 4:
    uhhhhhh figure out affinity thing. how do i determine if this layout is better than the last layout? i dont even want to think about mutation/exchanging parts yet
        does station object need more variables for affinity?
        I probably need a global varibale for affinity but not sure (if so i want higher = better)
